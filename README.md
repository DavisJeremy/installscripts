# Installscripts
## My (now) inappropriately named git repository
This is my repo for scripts, configuration files, etc. I currently use Ubuntu-based distros, at least for now, so most scripts will work for those. Some of the code (particularly for doing specific tasks, like the nautilus-to-nemo script) has been pulled from various places on the internet, and moving forward I will try to source them in the body of the code itself.
